print('The difference between 5 & 2.5 is', 5 - 2.5)

# Multiplying numbers
print('The product of 5 times 3 is', 5 * 3)
print('The product of 5 times 3.1 is', 5 * 3.1)

# Dividing numbers
print('The result of 9 by 3 is', 9 / 3)
print('The result of 9 by 3.1 is', 9 / 3.1)
print('The whole part of 9 by 3.1 is', int(9 / 3.1))

# Calculating division modulo
print('The result of 10 by 3 is ', 10 / 3)
print('The whole part of 10 by 3 is ', int(10 / 3))
print('The remaining of dividing 10 by 3 is ', 10 % 3)

# Raising powers
