- [x] Ask the user for a number. If the number is even, print 0, and if the number is odd, print 1.

- [x] Write a program to accept a string from the user and remove characters starting from zero up to 3 (inclusive) and prints the remaining string.
- [x] Write a python program to print the following poem (bonus: using a single print() statement).
  
  ```txt
  Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
      How I wonder what you are!
          Up above the world so high,
          Like a diamond in the sky.
  Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
      How I wonder what you are

                and catch a fish!
