***Lists are mutable sequence of items (of any type).***

## Declaring lists

[Go to code](../../tutorial/7-lists.py#L2)

```python
empty_list = []
```

## Adding items to lists

[Go to code](../../tutorial/7-lists.py#L5)

since the lists are mutable you can populate the list after its creation; using the `append()` function, as following

```python
names = []

names.append('Khaled')
names.append('Sally')
```

## Removing items from lists

[Go to code](../../tutorial/7-lists.py#L14)

You can remove any item from a list using the `pop()` function. By default, the `pop()` function removes **and returns** the last item in the list. You can specify the index of the item to be removed (popped).

```python
todo_list = [

  'workout',
  'study',
  '1h of gaming'
]

last_task = todo_list.pop()

print(last_task)    # '1h of gaming'
print(todo_list)    # [ 'workout', 'study' ]

first_task = todo_list.pop(0)

print(last_task)    # 'workout'
print(todo_list)    # [ 'study' ]
```

## Count the occurrences of a specific value in a list

[Go to code](../../tutorial/7-lists.py#L9)

Lists have the buildin function `count()` which accepts an item, then returns the number of times the specified item has been appearred in the list, see the example...

```python
quiz_points = [ 10, 9, 10, 8, 10, 5 ]

# If we are to retrieve the number of trainees who obtained 10 points
print(quiz_points.count(10))    # 3
```

## Sorting lists

[Go to code](../../tutorial/7-lists.py#L29)

Lists can be sorted - out of the box - using the `sort()` function. However, you can't sort lists having items of mixed types; such as strings and numbers, but you can sort integers and floating point numbers.

Note that the `sort()` function sorts the list **in place**; this means that the call to the `sort()` function will return None (returns nothing), and the **original** list will be sorted, see the following example...

```python
random_numbers = [ 6, 2, 8, 1, 3, 0, 4 ]

print(random_numbers.sort())  # None

print(random_numbers)         # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]
```
